# JNLP Agents

This repository is a collection of Docker images which combine the basics
to run a Jenkins JNLP agent with a standard Docker image.

This makes it easy to use upstream images from as Kubernetes pod templates,
Azure Container Instances, AWS ECS/Fargate, or within other Jenkins agent
systems which rely on JNLP.
